## 5 HTML tags that make the text italic

As I was reading the documentation of HTML, I saw the var tag. Initially, I thought it was related to variables. However, I had seen that it was making the text Italic. So I asked myself, how many HTML tags make text Italic.

I began researching how many HTML tags make the text italic and found 5 tags that do so.

# `<i>` tag
It is a common and well-known tag.
Display style- Inline
`<i>` elements are used to differentiate words from the surrounding text by styling italicized text without adding any emphasis to italicized text.

# `<em>` tag
Display Style - Inline.
The `<em>` element is used to indicate text that should receive more emphasis than the surrounding text.

# `<cite>` tag
Display style - Inline
Use the cite element to identify the source of a quotation or creative work, rather than the author or creator.

# `<dfn>` tag
Display style- Inline
When a term is enclosed in a `<dfn>` tag, browsers and web crawlers will understand that nearby text contains a definition of the term.

# `<var>` tag
Display style - Inline
Most browsers display text marked with <var> tags in italics. This element indicates a variable in a mathematical equation or computer program.
